# nosql-challenge
This Repo is based on fictional data that outlines food businesses in the UK. This source aligns with noSQL tasks such as adding, modifying and deleting data, before moving onto filtering and pipelines

There are two files in this repo:

1: NoSQL_setup_starter (jupyter)- Focuses on creating a new entry into the collection, filtering for relevant information to add to this entry, deleting irrelevant data, and modifying data types ready for the next file

2: NoSQL_analysis_starter (jupyter)- focus shifts towards sifting through the data with queries and pipelines before modifying these results into dataframes
